## Well done! ðŸŽ‰

You have successfully completed the blue-green deployment scenario.

You have created a `blue` and a `green` Deployment, and a Service named `front` that serves both Deployments.
You have also exported the YAML manifests for all components.

You can now apply these manifests in a new namespace or cluster to recreate the setup.

## Discussion

- Would scaling Deployment be a viable option to achieve, say, a 95%/5% traffic split?

- What about 99% / 1 %?
